        <h3>Meet lion</h3>
        <p>Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs,
        teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey.
        Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes ,
        that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black.
        The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age,
        genetics and hormones.
